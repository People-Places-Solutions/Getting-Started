# Welcome Jacobs P&PS GitHub

This Organization is a place to store your code and collaborate with others across the firm who are writing code. When you create a repository here, it is automatically [inner sourced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_source) to other Jacobs' employees with a GitHub License.  If you'd like an extended primer on inner source [here's a link to a video on it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDqEP1fhDNM)
